## Running Dev Server

#### Client development

For working on the client (new pages, etc):

npm run dev:client
```

This will run the webpack dev server with hot reload.

#### Server development

For working on the server:

```bash
npm run dev:server
```

This will build the server bundle for server-side rendering.
